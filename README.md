## ✅ Features

- **License Validation**: Automatically verify that all dependencies have compatible licenses.
- **Dataset Lineage & Traceability**: Ensure that the dataset source and changes are documented and auditable.
- **Risk Assessment (ISO 14971)**: Identify, evaluate, and prioritize risks in line with international medical device safety standards.
- **Model Drift Monitoring**: Detect changes in model behavior or data distribution that may impact performance.
- **Explainability Tools**: Integrate SHAP and LIME to make model decisions interpretable.

## 📈 Future Scope: Evolving Compliance in AI

AI compliance is an emerging challenge as AI becomes more embedded in regulated domains like healthcare. Future scope includes:

### 🔄 Dynamic Policy Updates

- Integrate real-time policy updates from regulators (e.g., FDA, MDR, CDSCO)
- Automatically retrain or disable models when out of policy

### 🔐 Privacy & Consent Monitoring

- Add modules for GDPR, HIPAA checks
- Monitor data usage and consent validity

### 🤖 Explainability in Deployment

- Generate real-time explanations during inference
- Support counterfactual or example-based explanations

### 📊 Versioned Model Registry

- Maintain model lineage, metrics, retraining history
- Store audit trails for every deployed model

### 🌐 Multimodal Compliance

- Extend support beyond tabular/image to include audio/video NLP models
